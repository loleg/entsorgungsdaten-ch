A [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) describing locations of waste collection and recycling stations in Switzerland.

# Data

We initially are using a dataset from the cities of Basel and Z端rich for this example.

The CSV file for Basel was obtained from https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/entsorgungsstellen/ and is also directly downloadable using the CKAN API. See attached example R program.

The CSV file for Z端rich is available from https://data.stadt-zuerich.ch/dataset/geo_sammelstelle and can be downloaded through the geo-viewer ordering process [at this link](https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/geodaten/download/Sammelstelle?format=10008). (Note that you need to provide an e-mail address, but the link appears in a few minutes in the browser after the request is made.)

# Preparation

No transformation needed, except to rename the file and place it in the `data` folder.

We used the [Data Package Creator](https://create.frictionlessdata.io/) tool to extract schema details from the data resources.
