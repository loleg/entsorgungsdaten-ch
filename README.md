A [Data Package](https://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) describing locations of waste collection and recycling stations in Switzerland.

# Data

We initially are using a dataset from Basel for this example. The CSV file `basel.csv` was obtained from https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/entsorgungsstellen/

> *Instructions: Accessible data files (ideally in simple data formats such as [CSV](https://frictionlessdata.io/guides/csv/), [JSON](http://json-schema.org/specification.html) and [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/)), as well as the raw data, are placed in the `data` folder. In this section you should mention the files and formats included. It is good to suggest purposes for this data, such as example applications or use cases. Include any relevant background, contact points, and links that may help people to use this data. You can find examples of this at [datahub.io](https://datahub.io) or [github.com/datasets](https://github.com/datasets), and further tips at [frictionlessdata.io](https://frictionlessdata.io/guides/data-package/) and [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/docs/data-packages/publish-faq)*.

# Preparation

No transformation needed, except to rename the file and place it in the `data` folder.

> *Instructions: describe here where you obtained the data, how it was created, where and how it was extracted, and any transformation steps that took place during publication. Link to the sources, as well as to any tools that were used. If you used any scripts to extract and convert the data, add them to a `script` folder in your repository.*
